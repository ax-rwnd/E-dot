# E-dot
*Drop the com.*

E-dot is a small e-commerce webserver built on MySQL and Python Flask.
The goal behind this project is not to create a large-scale framework for e-commerce sites, but to enable inexperienced to intermediate computer users to setup their own web-shops.

# Goals
* Generic store framework availability.
* Minimal installation hassle and easy code access.

# Issues
The project is a work-in-progress, which means that bugs and incomplete behavior will be commonplace.
